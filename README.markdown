About
-----
Teambox Notifier is a simple Google Chrome extension which places an icon in the Chrome toolbar to give status of the activity feed in [Teambox](http://teambox.com).

When new items appear in your activity feed a badge icon with the number of new items and a notification for each new item will display. Clicking the icon will clear the current badge counter.

If you are not logged in to Teambox, the icon will appear deactivated (desaturated). Logging in to Teambox will also activate Teambox Notifier.
